# Background
- Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) - virus that primarily affects birds but can spread to humans and other animals
- High mortality rate - about 50% for humans, 75-100% for poultry
- Very contagious - spreads through bodily fluids, feces, air particles, and consumption of raw animal products
- Hard to "cure" - infected birds must be euthanized, infections in humans can be treated with antiviral drugs
- USDA provides up-to-date data from 2022-present on HPAI detections in US

# Research Questions
1. How does the frequency with which agencies collect samples affect the number of HPAI cases detected?
    - Which agencies collect samples most frequently?
    - When do agencies collect samples most frequently (time of year)?
    - Where do agencies collect samples most frequently (geographic region)?
2. Is there a correlation between geographic region and season, and number of HPAI cases?
    - How does agency collection frequency influence and location affect this correlation?
3. What is the forecast of HPAI cases in the US (all states) for the next 6 months?
    - How does agency collection frequency and location affect this correlation?

# Agency Collection Frequency
Tabset with 3 or 4 visuals
Viz 1 - which agencies collect samples most frequently
Viz 2 - when do agencies collect samples most frequently
Viz 3 - where do agencies collect samples most frequently

# Region, Season, and HPAI Cases
Investigate correlation
Tabset with 3 visuals
Viz 1 - Cases by region
Viz 2 - Cases by season
Viz 3 - Cases by region + season combined w/ correlation coefficient

# 6-month Forecast
Forecast (somehow) next 6 months of HPAI cases across all US states
